{"name":"Kinematica","tagline":"Intuitive physics demonstrations, and tools for making them ","body":"## About Us\r\n\r\nKinematica was started a couple of graduate students in Columbia's Physics Department and is supported by the World Science Festival. We make fun physics simulations (most of which are integrated into [World Science U's](http://worldscienceu.com) courses and lecture series) and software tools for physics education.\r\n\r\n## Our Goals\r\n\r\n1. Find elegant ways to illustrate nonintuitive scientific phenomena through interactive simulations and demonstrations\r\n2. Bridge the divide between qualitative and quantitative\r\n3. Use simulation to show how simple examples extend to more complex ones\r\n4. Develop software tools that make it easier for us, and for other people, to make beautiful physics simulations\r\n\r\n## Our Projects\r\n\r\n### [Physics Simulations](physics-simulations)\r\n\r\nCheck out some of the physics demonstrations we've put together.\r\n\r\n### Kinematica.js (coming soon)\r\n\r\nKinematica.js will be an open-source tool for generating physics simulations in javascript with minimal boilerplate code. We are currently developing it as a way of boosting our own demo-writing efficiency while making it easier for others to casually contribute to the project.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nStefan Countryman: @stefco\r\n\r\nMichael Carapezza: @mac2305\r\n\r\nLiutauras Rusaitis: @rusaitis\r\n\r\nJulian Starr\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-63606206-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
